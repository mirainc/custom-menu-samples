# Sample Custom Menu - Vanilla Example

## Getting started

1. Run `yarn start:mock-server` // TODO: Replace with actual API
1. Run `npx serve .`

## Notes

This sample custom menu app provides an unopinionated example of how to create a custom menu with vanilla JS and without frameworks.
In production, it's strongly recommended to utilise a bundler to concatenate and minify third-party dependencies.

For more opinionated production-ready examples see the other two examples in this repository.
